# CIFAR-10_PyTorch

Developed a deep learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving high accuracy through advanced data augmentation and model architecture.

Implemented data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flip and random rotation to enhance the training dataset.

Designed a custom neural network architecture with multiple intermediate blocks, each consisting of convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and ReLU activation functions.

Utilized global average pooling and fully connected layers for the final classification.

Conducted training over 105 epochs using Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss.

Achieved a training accuracy of 91.54% and a test accuracy of 85.48%.
